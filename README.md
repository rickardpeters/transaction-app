# Transaction App

I created an app that would handle transactions of different products in different storages, to help keep track of the storage levels.
The main focus was on creating a backend that could handle and keep track of the different transactions, and to create a solid connection between the backend and the frontend.

This was one of my first projects that I tried to learn frontend-development using a framework like React.
There are certaintly a lot to be done about the code, and maybe in the future I might come back to this project!
